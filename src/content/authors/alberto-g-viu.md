Alberto is passionate about technology in general and software development in particular. He worked as IT Specialist before switching to development because he wanted to create programs and websites.
After many years building Drupal-related sites in both commercial and personal projects, he started moving out of the island looking for new adventures. He's now focused in becoming a great Go + Flutter engineer.
